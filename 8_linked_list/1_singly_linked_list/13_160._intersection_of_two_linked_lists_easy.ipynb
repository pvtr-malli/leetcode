    "Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.\n",

    "Custom Judge:\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):\n",

    "Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\n",
    "From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.\n",
    "- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.\n",

    "Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2\n",
    "Output: No intersection\n",
    "Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.\n",
