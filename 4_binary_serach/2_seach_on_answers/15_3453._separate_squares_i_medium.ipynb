    "Loose Tolerance (10): Estimating the height of a building.\n",
    "Scenario: If the actual height is 100 meters, any answer between 90 and 110 meters is acceptable.\n",
    "Moderate Tolerance (0.1): Measuring the temperature of a room.\n",
    "Scenario: If the true temperature is 20.0°C, an answer between 19.9°C and 20.1°C is acceptable.\n",
    "Ultra-Precise Tolerance (0.00001): Measuring the thickness of a human hair.\n",
    "Scenario: If the actual thickness is 0.10000 mm, your answer must be between 0.09999 mm and 0.10001 mm.\n",
    "Hence, The phrase \"Answers within 10⁻⁵ of the actual answer will be accepted\" means your answer must be within ±0.00001 of the true answer.\n",

    "Why Traditional Update Steps Don't Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing binary search on real numbers, we cannot use the traditional update steps like lo = mid + 1 or hi = mid - 1 that we often use for integer binary search. This is because:\n",
    "In integer binary search, the search space is discrete. Once you update with +1 or -1, you know you’re not missing any integer. For real numbers, the values are continuous.\n",
    "Now let's take an example for continous range. Consider the interval [0,1]. Unlike integers, there are infinitely many numbers between 0 and 1.\n",
    "Example: If you try updating like lo = mid + 1, then starting from [0, 1], mid would be 0.5 and updating would give you [1.5, 1], which is wrong.\n",
    "Even if you try a tiny fixed increment, there's always an infinite set of numbers between any two real values.\n",
    "Instead, we update:\n",
    "If the condition suggests the target is higher, set lo = mid.\n",
    "If lower, set hi = mid.\n",
    "Why We Need a Termination Condition Based on Tolerance?\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing binary search on real numbers, it's essential to decide when to stop the algorithm. since we can never perfectly converge on a continuous value. Here are two methods to achieve the required precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method1: Instead of searching for an exact match (which isn’t feasible with real numbers), we define a tolerance level (e.g., 10⁻⁵) The algorithm terminates when the search interval hi − lo is smaller than this tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose after several iterations you narrow the interval to:\n",
    "lo = 1.23456 and hi = 1.23457\n",
    "then, the interval width i.e., hi − lo = 0.00001 = 10⁻⁵\n",
    "The midpoint is:(1.23456 + 1.23457)/2.0 = 1.234565\n",
    "Hence, The maximum error is half the interval width:\n",
    "Error ≤ (10⁻⁵ / 2) = 5 × 10⁻⁶\n",
    "This error is within the desired tolerance, ensuring the answer is accurate to 5 decimal places.\n",

    "Method2: Instead of checking the interval width directly, you can perform a fixed number of iterations say 60. Each iteration halves the search interval, guaranteeing that after a sufficient number of iterations, the interval is extremely narrow.\n",
    "Assume an initial interval of width W.\n",
    "After each iteration, the width is halved. After 60 iterations, the width becomes: W/2 \n",
    "60\n",
    " \n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If W=1 intreval [0, 1] then 1/2 \n",

    "FAQ\n",
    "Question 1: In the binary search part, why don't we update lo when diff == 0, and only update hi?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Since the problem requires us to find the minimum possible height that balances the areas, even when diff == 0, the answer might not be exact due to floating-point precision issues. Therefore, we shift the upper bound hi downward to potentially obtain a lower value of mid, ensuring we approach the minimum height that satisfies the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: In my code, I just returned hi at the end of the loop. Is that acceptable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Yes, it is acceptable to return hi because by the time the binary search loop terminates, the interval [lo,hi] is extremely narrow — within the specified tolerance. At this point, lo, hi, and even the midpoint are nearly identical. Since the difference between them is negligible compared to the required precision, returning hi guarantees that the result is within the allowed error margin.\n",
