Type 1:

1. Linear Regression (From Scratch) — Very Important
2. Logistic Regression (From Scratch) — Very Important (almost same code with small changes, easy to prepare)
3. Neural Network (From Scratch) — Very Important (Impact making code, once prepared, you can impress any interviewer in ML coding round)
4. Decision Tree — Less Important
5. XGBoost — Less Important
6. K-Means Clustering — optimal value for k in k-means
7. KNN

NLP based:
1. TF-IDF 
2. Countvectorizer
3. basic tokenization mothods


Type 2: Performe commmon ML operations
- self-attnetion
- Barch Normalization
- Split the dataset into trian, test, validation 
- calculate pearson correlation
