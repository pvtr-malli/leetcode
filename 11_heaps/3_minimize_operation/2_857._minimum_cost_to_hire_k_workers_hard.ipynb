    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔶 Problem Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "You're given:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n` workers\n",
    "* For each worker:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `quality[i]`: their work quality\n",
    "  * `wage[i]`: the minimum wage they expect\n",

    "\n",
    "## 📜 Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Proportional pay based on quality**:\n",
    "   All workers must be paid in proportion to their **quality**.\n",
    "   That is, if Worker A has double the quality of Worker B, they should get **double the pay**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Minimum wage requirement**:\n",
    "   Each worker must be paid at least their **expected minimum wage**.\n",

    "\n",
    "But:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This ratio must be **at least** the `wage[i] / quality[i]` for every selected worker.\n",
