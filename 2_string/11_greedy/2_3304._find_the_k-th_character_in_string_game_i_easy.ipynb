    "\n",
    "Assume a string of lowercase letters is built using a number `k`, and for every bit in the binary of `k-1`, we modify the character based on whether the bit is `1` or not.\n",

    "## 🧠 The Key Insight:\n",

    "### 🔸 Binary Representation of `k-1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "k = 5\n",
    "k - 1 = 4 → binary: 100\n",
    "```\n",

    "We observe that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It has 3 bits.\n",
    "* It has one `1` bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "At each level (bit position), the operation might modify the string based on whether the bit is set (1) or not (0). If a bit is `1`, it means an increment (shift) happened at that level.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the **number of character changes (shifts from 'a' to 'b', 'b' to 'c', etc.)** is equal to the **number of `1`s in the binary representation of `k - 1`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the **Hamming Weight** or **population count**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Why `(k - 1)`?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is due to **0-based indexing** or how ranges typically work:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you have `k` possibilities, they're often indexed from `0` to `k - 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So operations are applied over those `k` values, and we analyze how those influence the final result.\n",
