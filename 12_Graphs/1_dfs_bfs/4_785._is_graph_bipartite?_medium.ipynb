    "There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).\n",
    "There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).\n",
