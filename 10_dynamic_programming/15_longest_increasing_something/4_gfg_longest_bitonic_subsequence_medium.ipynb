    "Given an array of positive integers. Find the maximum length of Bitonic subsequence. \n",
    "A subsequence of array is called Bitonic if it is first strictly increasing, then strictly decreasing. Return the maximum length of bitonic subsequence.\n",
    " \n",
    "Note : A strictly increasing or a strictly decreasing sequence should not be considered as a bitonic sequence\n",

    "Examples :\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 5, nums[] = [1, 2, 5, 3, 2]\n",
    "Output: 5\n",
    "Explanation: The sequence {1, 2, 5} is increasing and the sequence {3, 2} is decreasing so merging both we will get length 5.\n",
    "Input: n = 8, nums[] = [1, 11, 2, 10, 4, 5, 2, 1]\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: The bitonic sequence {1, 2, 10, 4, 2, 1} has length 6.\n",
    "Input: n = 3, nums[] = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: The decreasing or increasing part cannot be empty\n",
    "Input: n = 3, nums[] = [10, 10, 10]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: The subsequences must be strictly increasing or decreasing\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "1 ≤ length of array ≤ 103\n",
    "1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104\n",

    "Expected Complexities\n",
