    "## 🔥 Goal of the Problem Recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re given an array of **leaf values**, and we want to build a **binary tree** such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every node has either 0 or 2 children.\n",
    "* Leaf nodes are exactly the given array values.\n",
    "* **Non-leaf node value = product of largest leaf in left & right subtrees.**\n",
    "* We want to **minimize the sum** of all non-leaf node values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Intuition Behind the Greedy + Monotonic Stack Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s simplify:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Imagine merging two leaves creates a non-leaf node with cost `a * b`.\n",
    "* We must decide **in what order to merge** to minimize the total cost.\n",
    "* So, we must **avoid big multiplications** early — they blow up the total.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Greedy Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize total cost:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Always merge the smallest leaf with its nearest larger neighbor** — because merging two small values gives a smaller product.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where the **monotonic decreasing stack** helps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It maintains a decreasing order.\n",
    "* When we see a value `a` such that `a >= top of stack`, it means we’ve found a neighbor to merge with the smallest one.\n",

    "## 🔄 How it Works (Step-by-step)\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "arr = [6, 2, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stack = `[∞]`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Push 6 → `[∞, 6]`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 2 < 6 → push → `[∞, 6, 2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 4 ≥ 2 → pop 2\n",
    "   Now, merge 2 with the smaller of its two neighbors:\n",
    "   → left = 6, right = 4 → merge with `min(6, 4) = 4`\n",
    "   → `cost = 2 * 4 = 8`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Then continue pushing 4 → `[∞, 6, 4]`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Cleanup remaining stack:\n",
    "   Pop 4 → merge with 6 → `4 * 6 = 24`\n",
    "\n",
    "Total = 8 + 24 = 32 ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤝 Why It Works (Key Principle)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is based on a known greedy strategy called the **\"Greedy Merge of Least Local Cost\"**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Whenever you must pair values, always pair the **smallest one** with the **smaller of its neighbors** to prevent large costs later.\n",
    "* The monotonic stack efficiently finds that smallest one and its best neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We're always trying to remove the \"weakest link\" in the chain with the **least cost** before it becomes costly.\n",
    "* The stack gives us quick access to such \"links\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Guarantees:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each element is processed once.\n",
    "* The greedy decisions are **locally optimal** and **globally minimal** because of the cost structure (product is superlinear).\n",
