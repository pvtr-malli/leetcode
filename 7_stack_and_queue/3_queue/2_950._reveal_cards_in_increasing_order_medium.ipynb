    "We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].\n",

    "# how to explain this:\n",
    "‚ÄúWe are given a set of cards, and we want to reorder them such that, if we simulate the revealing process‚Äîreveal one, move one to bottom, reveal one, move one, etc.‚Äîthe revealed cards come out in increasing order.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† Intuition:\n",
    "‚ÄúInstead of trying to simulate the revealing process forward, which is hard to control, I thought backwards:\n",
    "If I already knew the final revealed order‚Äîsorted increasing‚Äîcould I reconstruct the initial deck order that would produce it?‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "üß¨ Analogy to Help:\n",
    "‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like doing a reverse-engineering of a machine.\n",
    "I know what output I want, and I walk backwards to figure out the input configuration that will give me that output.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "üîÑ Reverse Simulation Idea:\n",
    "‚ÄúYes. The idea is to take the sorted deck (i.e., the desired reveal order), and reverse simulate the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start from the last card (largest).\n",
    "\n",
    "Build the initial deck backwards by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moving the bottom card (last in deque) to the top (simulate reverse of move-to-bottom),\n",
    "- Placing the current card on top.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, I'm reconstructing what the deck should look like before the reveal process starts, so that when the real process runs, it gives the increasing sequence.‚Äù\n"
